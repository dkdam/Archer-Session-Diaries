# Experience

**Day 0**: Thinking of a concept and models of a archery scoring app and how the user will use it

**Day 1**: Had to propose my plan on how to build it and created a view map and a view page map of how I'm gonna build it.

**Day 2**: Took some time thinking of a model and when building it I keep failing to build the basic structure so I decided to go back to square one and which I decided to head down to the range and actually did a scoring round.

**Day 3**: Had a good sense of understanding the structure and model I had to build and had to get on it. Started by developing the login use accounts and set up the archery gear section.

**Day 4**: Struggled to build a full functioning site and learnt to deploy the site using heroku. End of the day got the site and the logins working.

**Day 5**: Coded the functions to get my app working but I had alot of trouble trying to applying it to rails along with how to store the date with it. With the big help from Lodan it turns out I had to create another model or 2 which I had 3 before and now I may have to build 4-5 models.

**Day 6**: After many struggles to get scoring app working I decided to put this in the side as I will not get it done by the end of the week. I have decided instead to create a diary website instead and keep it simple as a 3 models.

**Day 7**: I have all the necessary functions working and how my site going as it needs to go. I have struggled alot with getting the links to navigate between the associations of both the equipment gears and the blog post together. After some Lodan help I had it working until I deployed it...
