# My Learning Experience

### Day 0 
Thinking of a concept and models of a archery scoring app and how the user will use it

### Day 1
 Had to propose my plan on how to build it and created a view map and a view page map of how I'm gonna build it.

### Day 2 
Took some time thinking of a model and when building it I keep failing to build the basic structure so I decided to go back to square one and which I decided to head down to the range and actually did a scoring round.

### Day 3 
Had a good sense of understanding the structure and model I had to build and had to get on it. Started by developing the login use accounts and set up the archery gear section.
### Day 4
Struggled to build a full functioning site and learnt to deploy the site using heroku. End of the day got the site and the logins working.

### Day 5
Coded the functions to get my app working but I had alot of trouble trying to applying it to rails along with how to store the date with it. With the big help from Lodan it turns out I had to create another model or 2 which I had 3 before and now I may have to build 4-5 models.

### Day 6
After many struggles to get scoring app working I decided to put this in the side as I will not get it done by the end of the week. I have decided instead to create a diary website instead and keep it simple as a 3 models.

### Day 7
I have all the necessary functions working and how my site going as it needs to go. I have struggled alot with getting the links to navigate between the associations of both the equipment gears and the blog post together. After some Lodan help I had it working until I deployed it...

### Day 8
Had alot fo help getting some of my deployment working. I can't seem to figure out my new and show pages as it keeps crashing. I didn't know how to actually log into the terminal of Heroku to get this running and after with the help of Joel and Lodan once again I had to rollback, migrate and reset my deployment finally worked. Had learnt more about Heroku and fixing errors than any other days I've done.

### Day 9
Done everything that I can on this project and it's all about the README and CSS now so I'll at least make it pretty. <3
