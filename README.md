# README

This project showing the actual build of a website. The goal is to create a web-app doing my archery scoring rounds and keeping progress of my score.

# Experience

**Day 0**: Thinking of a concept and models of a archery scoring app and how the user will use it

**Day 1**: Had to propose my plan on how to build it and created a view map and a view page map of how I'm gonna build it.

**Day 2**: Took some time thinking of a model and when building it I keep failing to build the basic structure so I decided to go back to square one and which I decided to head down to the range and actually did a scoring round.

**Day 3**: Had a good sense of understanding the structure and model I had to build and had to get on it. Started by developing the login use accounts and set up the archery gear section.

**Day 4**: Struggled to build a full functioning site and learnt to deploy the site using heroku. End of the day got the site and the logins working.
